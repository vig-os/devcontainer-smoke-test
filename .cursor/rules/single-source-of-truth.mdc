# Single Source of Truth (SSoT)

Every piece of knowledge must live in exactly one place. Reference it everywhere else.

## Core Principle

If information exists in a file, **link to it** — never copy it.

## Applies to

- **Documentation as code** — docs live in the repo, version-controlled alongside the code they describe.
- **Config as code** — configuration is declarative, checked in, and machine-readable. No manual portal settings.
- **Infrastructure as code** — all infra is defined in versioned templates/scripts. No click-ops.
- **Rules & standards** — define once in a canonical file, reference via path or link. Never duplicate across READMEs, comments, or wikis.
- **Comments & docstrings** — don't repeat what a referenced doc already says. Link to the source instead.

## In Practice

- Before writing explanatory text, check if a canonical source already exists.
- If it does → link to it (`see docs/COMMIT_MESSAGE_STANDARD.md`).
- If it doesn't → create the canonical file first, then link to it.
- Never maintain the same information in two places.
