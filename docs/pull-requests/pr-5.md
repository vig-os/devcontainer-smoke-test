# [PR 5](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test/pull/5) ci: add repository_dispatch listener stub

## Description

Adds a `repository_dispatch` workflow stub to support testing cross-repository dispatch events, while bringing `main` up to date with current bootstrap, CI validation, and project documentation updates already present on `dev`.

## Type of Change

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [x] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml`
  - Adds a dedicated workflow listening for `repository_dispatch`
  - Logs dispatch metadata/payload to validate trigger behavior
- `.devcontainer/scripts/setup-gh-repo.sh`, `.github/actions/setup-env/action.yml`, `.devcontainer/docker-compose.yml`, `.devcontainer/justfile.base`, `uv.lock`
  - Aligns bootstrap and setup flow with CI expectations
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
  - Removes unavailable hooks to keep CI checks consistent
- `README.md`, `docs/issues/issue-1.md`, `docs/pull-requests/pr-2.md`
  - Expands project documentation and traceability artifacts
- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Adds Unreleased entries for issue-tracked workflow/bootstrap updates

## Changelog Entry

### Added

- Deployed initial project scaffold
- Created [README.md](./README.md)
- **Bootstrap scripts and lock state aligned for CI validation** ([#1](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test/issues/1))
  - Updated repository bootstrap/setup behavior to match the current development and CI flow
  - Refreshed pre-commit and dependency lock state to keep validation runs consistent
- **repository_dispatch listener stub** ([#3](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test/issues/3))
  - Added a dedicated workflow that listens for `repository_dispatch` events
  - Logs dispatch payload metadata as a minimal foundation for later cross-repo integration

## Testing

- [x] Tests pass locally (`just test-pytest`)
- [ ] Manual testing performed (describe below)

### Manual Testing Details

N/A

```

The heredoc syntax is incorrect. In bash, when using `<<-JSON`, the heredoc content and closing delimiter must be structured properly. The redirection `>/dev/null 2>&1` and conditional `; then` cannot appear on line 47 after the heredoc opener. This will cause a syntax error when the script is executed.

The heredoc should be restructured so that the command, heredoc content, and redirections are properly separated. For example, the entire `gh api` command with its heredoc should complete before the redirection and conditional check.
```suggestion
			--input - <<-JSON >/dev/null 2>&1
{"selected_repository_ids":[$REPO_ID]}
JSON
			then
```

  Thanks for the review. This is actually valid bash — placing `>/dev/null 2>&1; then` on the same line as a heredoc opener is standard POSIX/bash syntax. Bash defers reading the heredoc body from subsequent lines while still parsing the `;` and `then` on the opener line. Confirmed with `bash -n`: no syntax errors.
