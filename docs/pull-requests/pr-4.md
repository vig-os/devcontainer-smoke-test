# [PR 4](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test/pull/4) ci: add repository_dispatch listener stub

## Description

Adds a stub GitHub Actions workflow that listens for `repository_dispatch` events and logs payload metadata for smoke-test integration groundwork. Also updates Unreleased changelog entries to reflect both the dispatch listener and prior bootstrap/setup alignment work.

## Type of Change

- [ ] `feat` -- New feature
- [ ] `fix` -- Bug fix
- [ ] `docs` -- Documentation only
- [ ] `chore` -- Maintenance task (deps, config, etc.)
- [ ] `refactor` -- Code restructuring (no behavior change)
- [ ] `test` -- Adding or updating tests
- [x] `ci` -- CI/CD pipeline changes
- [ ] `build` -- Build system or dependency changes
- [ ] `revert` -- Reverts a previous commit
- [ ] `style` -- Code style (formatting, whitespace)

### Modifiers

- [ ] Breaking change (`!`) -- This change breaks backward compatibility

## Changes Made

- `.github/workflows/repository-dispatch.yml`
  - Adds a dedicated `repository_dispatch` workflow for `smoke-test-trigger`
  - Introduces a single stub job that logs key dispatch metadata from `github.event` payload fields
  - Uses constrained permissions (`contents: read`) and a short timeout
- `CHANGELOG.md`
  - Adds an Unreleased entry for issue `#3` describing the repository dispatch listener stub
  - Adds an Unreleased entry for issue `#1` documenting bootstrap/setup and lock-state alignment

## Changelog Entry

- **repository_dispatch listener stub** ([#3](https://github.com/vig-os/devcontainer-smoke-test/issues/3))
  - Added a dedicated workflow that listens for `repository_dispatch` events
  - Logs dispatch payload metadata as a minimal foundation for later cross-repo integration
