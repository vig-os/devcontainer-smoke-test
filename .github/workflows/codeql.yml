# CodeQL Static Analysis
#
# Runs GitHub CodeQL analysis on Python scripts used in the build toolchain.
# While these are build tools (not product code), static analysis provides
# defense-in-depth for scripts that handle git operations, file I/O, and
# subprocess execution.
#
# Triggers:
#   - Pull requests to dev, release/**, and main
#   - Pushes to main (post-merge analysis)
#   - Weekly schedule (catch newly disclosed patterns)
