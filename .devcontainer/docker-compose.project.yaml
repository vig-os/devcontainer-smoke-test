# docker-compose.project.yaml
#
# Project/team-specific compose overrides.
#
# Use this file for configuration that should be SHARED with your team:
#   - Project-specific sidecars (databases, caches, etc.)
#   - Shared environment variables
#   - Additional volume mounts needed by everyone
#
# This file is:
#   - Git tracked (commit your changes)
#   - Preserved during devcontainer upgrades (init-workspace.sh --force)
#
# For personal/local overrides, use docker-compose.local.yaml instead.
#
# Example:
#
#   services:
#     devcontainer:
#       environment:
#         - PROJECT_API_URL=https://api.example.com
#
#     postgres:
#       image: postgres:16-alpine
#       environment:
#         POSTGRES_PASSWORD: devpassword
#       volumes:
#         - postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
#
#   volumes:
#     postgres-data:

services: {}
